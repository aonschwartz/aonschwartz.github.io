## Audio

In 2020, I attended a graduate program in audio production at the Salt Institute for Documentary Storytelling at the Maine College of Art. Thus, the bulk of my audio work to date has concerned the lives of Mainers. In undergrad, I co-created, co-produced, and co-hosted a radio program as a branch of the college newspaper. 

Currently I do freelance audio production and editing. You can find work samples on my [Soundcloud.](https://soundcloud.com/andrew-schwartz-191964276)
