## Audio

I produce audio stories for radio and podcasts. I'm available for freelance production, fact checking, tape syncs, and editing projects.

I've worked in various capacities in the audio world. I do post-production on "Raise The Line," a podcast about the healthcare industry, and recent production work includes [a piece](https://beta.prx.org/stories/394771) on alternative therapies for military veterans, and a set of non-narrated audio stories about life amid the pandemic in Seattle's refugee community. I also produced [Tour to the Wonderful Podcast,](https://open.spotify.com/show/1wkiVWYBdJGuUbLs91xFIM?si=-5Gj4OLZTaGWKDYPmaF-Cw) about a Rabbi and his wife's charitable RV journey across America. You can find more work samples on my [Soundcloud.](https://soundcloud.com/andrew-schwartz-191964276)

In 2020, I attended a graduate program in audio production at the Salt Institute for Documentary Storytelling at the Maine College of Art.
