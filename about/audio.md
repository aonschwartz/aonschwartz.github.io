## Audio

I produce audio stories for radio and podcasts. Currently I'm producing [Tour to the Wonderful Podcast,](https://open.spotify.com/show/1wkiVWYBdJGuUbLs91xFIM?si=-5Gj4OLZTaGWKDYPmaF-Cw) about a Rabbi and his wife's charitable RV journey across America. 

I'm available for freelance production and editing projects. In 2020, I attended a graduate program in audio production at the Salt Institute for Documentary Storytelling at the Maine College of Art. You can find samples of my work on my [Soundcloud.](https://soundcloud.com/andrew-schwartz-191964276)
