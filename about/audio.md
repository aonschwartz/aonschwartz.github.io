## Audio

I produce audio stories for radio and podcasts.

In 2020, I attended a graduate program in audio production at the Salt Institute for Documentary Storytelling at the Maine College of Art. In undergrad, I co-created, co-produced, and co-hosted a radio program as a branch of the college newspaper. 

Currently I do freelance audio production and editing. You can find samples of my work on my [Soundcloud.](https://soundcloud.com/andrew-schwartz-191964276)
