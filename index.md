## I'm Andrew
I'm a freelance journalist with a focus on labor and the American west. My journalism has appeared in *The New Republic*, *In These Times*, *The Baffler*, and *The Outline* among other publications. I previously worked as a general assignment reporter with the Walla Walla Union-Bulletin, a local newspaper in Washington State. On the side I also co-editÂ *Mangoprism*, and online culture journal dedicated to publishing new writers. I currently live in Seattle, Washington, where I grew up. Get in touch!
