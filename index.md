## I'm Andrew

I'm a freelance journalist, audio producer, and fact checker, with a focus on labor and political movements. My work has appeared in *The New Republic*, *In These Times*, *High Country News*, *Dissent*, *The Baffler*, *Chicago*, and *The Outline*, among other publications. I previously worked as a general assignment reporter with the *Walla Walla Union-Bulletin,* a local newspaper in Washington State.

I also do freelance editing and audio production, and I co-editÂ *[Mangoprism](https://mangoprism.com/)*, an online culture journal that publishes emerging writers. I am a member of the National Writers Union and the Freelance Solidarity Project. I'm based in Bozeman, Montana. Get in touch!
