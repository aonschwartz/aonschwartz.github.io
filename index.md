## I'm Andrew Schwartz
I'm a freelance journalist with a focus on labor, public policy, and the American West. My work has appeared in *The New Republic*, *In These Times*, *The Baffler*, *Chicago*, and *The Outline*, among other publications. I previously worked as a general assignment reporter with the Walla Walla Union-Bulletin, a local newspaper in Washington State.

On the side I also co-editÂ *[Mangoprism](https://mangoprism.com/)*, an online culture journal dedicated to publishing new writers. I currently live in Seattle, Washington, where I grew up. Get in touch!
