## I'm Andrew

I'm journalist, audio producer, editor, and fact checker with a focus on labor, religion, and political movements. I currently cover religion for the *Chattanooga Times Free Press.* My work has appeared in *The New Republic*, *Mother Jones,* *In These Times*, *High Country News*, *Dissent*, *The Baffler*, *Chicago*, *The Outline*, and on NPR member stations.

I've previously worked as a contributing social media editor at *The New Republic*, and as a general assignment reporter with the *Walla Walla Union-Bulletin,* a local newspaper in Washington State.

I also do freelance editing and fact checking, and I am the editor ofÂ *[Mangoprism](https://mangoprism.com/)*, which publishes essays, criticism, and fiction by emerging writers. You can reach me at my email, linked below.
