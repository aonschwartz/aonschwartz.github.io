## I'm Andrew

I've spent years covering politics, business, and cultural and spiritual movements. I currently report on healthcare in Portland Oregon for Willamette Week. Before this I covered religion, immigration and other policy and human interest matters for the *Chattanooga Times Free Press.* My work has appeared in *The New Republic*, *Mother Jones,* *In These Times*, *High Country News*, *Dissent*, *The Baffler*, *Chicago*, *The Outline*, and on NPR member stations.

I've previously worked as a contributing social media editor at *The New Republic*, and as a general assignment reporter with the *Walla Walla Union-Bulletin,* a local newspaper in Washington State.

I also do freelance editing and fact checking, and I ran and editedÂ *[Mangoprism](https://mangoprism.com/)*, which published essays, criticism, and fiction by emerging writers. You can reach me at my email, linked below.
